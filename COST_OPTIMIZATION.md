# GitHub Actions Cost Optimization Report

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Found

### Current Monthly Costs (August 1-12, 2025)
- **Actions macOS 3-core**: 174.5 min = **$13.96** ($0.08/min)
- **Actions Windows**: 253 min = **$4.05** ($0.016/min) 
- **Actions Linux**: 374 min = **$2.99** ($0.008/min)
- **Total**: **$20.69** for just 12 days = **~$52/month**

### Root Causes of High Costs

1. **VMs Not Shutting Down Properly**
   - Jobs waiting 24 hours for runners due to billing issues
   - No timeouts on workflows causing runaway costs
   - Matrix jobs continuing even after failures

2. **Expensive Runner Usage**
   - macOS runners cost **10x more** than Linux ($0.08 vs $0.008/min)
   - Windows runners cost **2x more** than Linux
   - Running unnecessary duplicate jobs

3. **Billing Account Issues**
   - Payment failures preventing proper job termination
   - Jobs queuing indefinitely, consuming time

## âœ… Fixes Applied

### 1. Workflow Optimizations
- **Added timeouts to all jobs** (15-60 minutes)
- **Enabled `fail-fast: true`** to stop on first failure
- **Removed duplicate jobs** (eliminated extra macOS/Windows runners)
- **Consolidated Ubuntu versions** to ubuntu-22.04 only

### 2. Cost-Efficient Matrix Strategy
```yaml
# BEFORE: 7 expensive jobs
- ubuntu-20.04, ubuntu-22.04, macos-12, macos-13, windows-2019, windows-2022
# AFTER: 4 essential jobs  
- ubuntu-22.04 (2 jobs), macos-13 (1 job), windows-2022 (1 job)
```

### 3. New Development Workflow
- Created `test-dev.yml` for daily development (Linux only)
- Expensive cross-platform testing only on releases
- **Potential savings: 70-80% for regular development**

### 4. Runner Migration
- Removed deprecated `windows-2019` (retired June 2025)
- Eliminated redundant macOS-12 job
- Consolidated to essential platforms only

## ðŸ’° Expected Savings

### Monthly Cost Projection:
- **Before**: ~$52/month (current trend)
- **After**: ~$15-20/month (60-70% reduction)
- **Development workflow**: ~$3-5/month (Linux only)

### Per-Workflow Savings:
| Runner Type | Before | After | Savings |
|-------------|---------|--------|---------|
| macOS | 2 jobs | 1 job | ~$7/run |
| Windows | 2 jobs | 1 job | ~$2/run |
| Linux | 2 jobs | 2 jobs | $0 |

## ðŸ”§ Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Fix Billing Issues (CRITICAL)
```
GitHub Settings â†’ Billing & Plans â†’ Fix:
- Payment method issues
- Spending limits
- Account suspension
```

### 2. Monitor Usage
- Check billing dashboard daily for unusual spikes
- Set up budget alerts at $20/month
- Review long-running jobs immediately

### 3. Workflow Strategy
- Use `test-dev.yml` for regular development
- Use `test-release.yml` only for releases/important PRs
- Run cross-platform tests manually when needed

## ðŸ“Š Usage Monitoring

### Warning Signs to Watch:
- Daily costs > $2
- Any job running > 30 minutes
- macOS usage > 20 minutes/day
- Consistent failed jobs with long runtimes

### Quick Cost Check:
```bash
# Linux job should cost ~$0.24 (30 min Ã— $0.008)
# Windows job should cost ~$0.48 (30 min Ã— $0.016) 
# macOS job should cost ~$2.40 (30 min Ã— $0.08)
```

## ðŸš€ Advanced Optimizations (Future)

1. **Conditional Workflows**: Only run expensive jobs on release tags
2. **Self-hosted Runners**: For very high usage (>$100/month)
3. **Caching Strategy**: Improve build cache hit rates
4. **Dependency Updates**: Automated but cost-controlled

## ðŸ“ž Emergency Contacts

If costs spike suddenly:
1. Check GitHub billing dashboard
2. Cancel running workflows immediately
3. Investigate failed jobs with long runtimes
4. Contact GitHub Support if billing issues persist
